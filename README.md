# IFEM PoroElasticity


## Introduction

This module contains PoroElasticity libraries and applications built
using the IFEM library.

### Getting all dependencies

1. Install IFEM from https://github.com/OPM/IFEM

### Getting the code

This is done by first navigating to the folder in which you want IFEM installed and typing

    git clone https://github.com/OPM/IFEM-Elasticity Elasticity
    git clone https://github.com/OPM/IFEM-PoroElasticity PoroElasticity

The build system uses sibling directory logic to locate the IFEM-Elasticity
module.

### Compiling the code

To compile, first navigate to the root catalogue `<App root>`.

1. `cd <App root>`
2. `mkdir Debug`
3. `cd Debug`
5. `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..`
6. `make `

this will compile the library and the poro elasticity applications.
The binaries can be found in the 'bin' subfolder.
Change all instances of `Debug` with `Release` to drop debug-symbols, 
but get faster running code.

### Testing the code

IFEM is using cmake test system. To compile run all regression- and unit-tests, navigate to your build 
folder (i.e. `<App root>/Debug`) and type

    make check
